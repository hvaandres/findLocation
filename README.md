# findLocation

Did you lost your phone? or Did you got your phone stolen? I will recommend you to look into this python script...


# Website for the Geolocation

I used [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/)

# Phone number

In the my_number.py, you will need to add your telephone number with the country code

# Location

We will be getting the latitute and the longitude and latitude + we will get an html with a map to give you an idea of where your phone can be located.

# Note

This project is just a test & is just used for educational content
